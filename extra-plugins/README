This file contains instructions for building the v8-juice plugins
repository, which is available from:

http://code.google.com/p/v8-juice/source/browse/extra-plugins


To build with GNU Make, you must have 'libv8-juice-config' in your
$PATH (it gets installed by the v8-juice build process) or you must
tweak src/plugin_template.make to suite your v8-juice installation.

Then:
        cd src/PluginName
        make && make install


To build with scons, simply run 'scons' from the top-most build
directory. You may need to tweak the SConstruct file for your system
(e.g. to set the lib path for sqlite3, if it's not in the default
place). To install the plugins, move the generated DLLs to
PREFIX/lib/v8/juice/, where PREFIX is the installation location of
libv8-juice (e.g. /usr/local (i normally use $HOME)).
