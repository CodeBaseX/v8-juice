/** @def WHIO_CONFIG_ENABLE_STATIC_MALLOC
   Changing this only has an effect when building this library
   or when building extensions which want to follow these
   conventions...

   If WHIO_CONFIG_ENABLE_STATIC_MALLOC is true then certain operations
   which are normally done via malloc() and free() are instead
   done first via a static list of pre-allocated objects and then
   (if the list is all used up) fall back malloc()/free().
   This i not strictly thread-safe, but for some use cases this isn't
   significant.

   When using this we might not actually save much dynamic memory
   (e.g.  whio_dev is only 12 bytes per object on 32-bit platforms),
   but we potentially save many calls to malloc(). That depends on the
   application, of course, but this idea was implemented for libwhefs,
   where keeping mallocs down is a goal and we create an unusually
   high number of whio_dev objects. In that lib, we were able to cut a
   typical use case from 19 whio-related mallocs down to 1 (and that
   one happend in fopen(), beneath the whio_dev FILE handler, so we
   couldn't avoid it).

   Note that this approach to allocation is inherently not
   thread-safe, so if you need to create/destroy whio_dev objects from
   multiple threads, do not build with this option turned on. If you
   only create and destroy whio_dev objects within a single thread,
   this option can potentially save many calls to malloc() (and should
   perform much better).

/** @page page_whio_dev whio_dev I/O API

   Author: Stephan Beal (http://wanderinghorse.net/home/stephan/)

   License: Public Domain

   whio encapsulates an i/o device API. It originally developed as
   parts of two other libraries, but the parts were found to be generic
   enough (and complementary enough) to fork out into a single library.

   The API provides interfaces for working with random-access devices
   (via the whio_dev interface) and sequential streams (via the
   whio_stream interface).

   Features:

   - Easy to use - modelled after the standard FILE API.

   - Comes with back-end implementations supporting FILE handles,
   dynamic memory buffers (with the option to expand on demand),
   and client-specified memory ranges (similar to mmap()).

   - Utility functions for doing common things, such as finding the
   size of a device, encoding/decoding certain basic types, and doing
   printf-style formatted output to devices.

   - An ioctl-like interface to perform some device-specific operations
   (for those times when genericness just won't do the job).


   Requirements:

   - Some C99 features are used, but those which are are normally
   enabled by compilers even outside of C99 mode. (This of course
   depends on the compiler version.)

   - It unfortunately needs fileno() in one place. fileno() is not
   specified by C89, but is found in most (all?) UNIX environments and
   is specified by POSIX. (It is apparently impossible to truncate
   a file without either the file's name or file handle number, as opposed
   to via a FILE handle.)


   This code has been shown to compile and pass basic sanity checks on:

   - Linux x86/32 with gcc 4.3.x and tcc
   - Linux x86/64 with gcc 4.2.x and tcc
   - Solaris 10 on sparcv9 (v240) with gcc 3.4.3 and SunStudio 12

   Example:
@code
char const * fname = "myfile.out";
whio_dev * dev = whio_dev_for_filename( fname, "r+" );
dev->api->write( dev, "hi, world!\n", 11 ); // 11 = size of the data bytes
dev->api->finalize( dev ); // flush and close device

// Now read it back:
dev = whio_dev_for_filename( fname, "r" );
enum { bufSize = 1024 };
char buf[bufSize]; // input buffer
whio_size_t n = 0;
while( 0 != (n = dev->api->read( dev, buf, bufSize ) ) )
{
    printf("Read %"WHIO_SIZE_T_PFMT" bytes\n", n );
}
dev->api->finalize(dev);
@endcode

Note the use of WHIO_SIZE_T_PFMT instead of "%%u", in the printf call,
so that the code will work correctly with varying sizes of
whio_size_t.

/**
   whio_dev is an interface for communicating with an underlying
   random access data store. It is modelled after the
   POSIX-standard FILE API, and it "should" be able to act as a
   wrapper for any stream type for which we can implement the
   appropriate operations. The most significant limitation is that the
   underlying device type must support random read/write access (if it
   does not, not all operations of this type will be meaningful).

   There is no "default" whio_dev implementation - each underlying
   data store needs a different implementation. This type defines the
   conventions of the interface as specifically as possible, however.

   The member functions of this struct are abstracted into the
   whio_dev_api class (via the 'api' member of this class). The
   primary reason for this is because all instances of a certain class
   of whio_devices, in practice, share a single set of implementation
   functions. By referencing the functions this way we save
   (sizeof(whio_dev_api) - sizeof(whio_dev_api*)) bytes on each instance
   of whio_dev, and in its place we have a single shared (and static)
   instance of the implementation's API object.

   Thread safety: it is never legal to use any given whio_dev instance
   from more than one thread at a single time, and doing so will
   almost certainly corrupt the internal state of the stream. e.g. its
   read/write position may be moved by another thread, causing a read
   or write to go somewhere other than desired. It is in theory not
   problematic for multiple threads to share one whio_dev instance as
   long as access to the device is strictly serialized via a
   marshaller and device positioning operations are implemented taking
   that into account.

   of the object are cleaned up (see whio_dev_free() for details).

   Clients of whio_dev objects SHOULD NOT use this routine - it is
   intended for use by whio_dev factory/initialization routines for
   reasons explained below.

   This function is not required to be thread safe nor reentrant, and
   a given implementation may use static data if needed. If it
   dynamically allocates memory for its internal use then it "should"
   clean up that memory via an atexit() handler or custom cleanup
   mechanism beyond the scope of this interface.

   The default implementation simply returns the result of calling
   malloc(sizeof(whio_dev)).

   A side effect of the undefined allocation rules is that devices
   returned from this function may not be valid if used after
   main() exits (e.g. via an atexit() handler) because the underlying
   allocation mechanism might have been cleaned up already.

   Why this function exists:

   As part of a related project i am looking to avoid using malloc()
   when necessary. For that project i would like to provide my own
   allocation pool for whio_dev objects (which are allocated
   relatively often in that framework). So, to that end, the i/o

/** @page page_whio_stream whio_stream C Stream API

  The whio_stream API provides an abstract interface for sequential
  streams which are either read-only or write-only. In practice, this
  type of stream is often the only type an application has access to
  for certain operations (as opposed to a full-fledged i/o device with
  random access, as modelled by the whio_dev API). This API is similar
  to that of whio_dev, but is somewhat smaller (because sequential
  streams have fewer requirements than random-access streams do).

/** @struct whio_stream

   whio_stream is an abstract interface for sequential streams. There
   is no default implementation - custom implementations must be
   provided which can handle specific stream types, e.g. FILE handles,
   an in-memory buffer, or a socket.

   The proper way to create any stream instance is from a factory
   function. The function may take any arguments necessary for
   constructing a new stream (or connecting to an existing one). For
   example, to create a stream for a FILE handle we might do:

   @code
   whio_stream * theStream = whio_stream_for_FILE(stdin,false);
   @endcode

   The public API of a stream object is accessed like:

   @code
   theStream->api->write( theStream, ... );
   @endcode

   (The first parameter as the equivalent of a "this" pointer,
   so we can get at instance-specific data.)

   For an explanation of why the "extra" api member exists, see the
   documentation for the whio_dev interface, which uses this same
   technique.

   The proper way to destroy a whio_stream object is:

   @code
   theStream->api->finalize(theStream);
   @endcode

   Implementations are responsible for properly implementing the
   finalize() member. Ownership of the underlying native stream is
   defined by the factory function which creates the stream.

   For examples of creating concrete implementations of this type,
   see the files whio_stream_FILE.c and whio_stream_dev.c.

/**
   Creates a whio_dev object which will use the underlying FILE
   handle. On success, ownership of f is defined by the takeOwnership
   argument (see below) and the returned object must eventually be finalized with
   dev->api->finalize(dev).

   For purposes of the whio_dev interface, any parts which have
   implementation-specified behaviour will behave as they do
   for the local FILE-related API. e.g. ftruncate() may or may
   not be able to extend a file, depending on the platform
   and even the underlying filesystem type.

   The takeOwnership argument determines the ownerhsip of f: if the
   function succeeds and takeOwnership is true then f's ownership is
   transfered to the returned object. In all other cases ownership is
   not changed. If the device owns f then closing the device
   will also close f. If the device does not own f then f must
   outlive the returned device.

   Peculiarities of this whio_dev implementation:

   - ioctl() is very limited. The definition of the pseudo-standard
   ioctl() does not allow us to blindly pass on elipse arguments to
   it, so we cannot simply proxy the calls.

   - See the docs for whio_dev_ioctl_FILE_fd for how to fetch the
   underlying file descriptor.

   - The iomode() member will always return -1 because it cannot know
   (without trying to write) if f is writeable.

   @see whio_dev_for_filename()
*/

/**
   Similar to whio_dev_for_FILE(), but takes a filename and an
   access mode specifier in the same format expected by fopen().
   In addition, the returned object internally uses the lower-level
   read(), write(), lseek(), etc. API instead of fread(), fwrite(),
   fseek(), etc. This is, for some use cases, more performant, and is
   compatible with fcntl()-style locking.

   It is ill advised to mix use of the POSIX file API and the
   lower-level APIs. The returned object uses the lower-level APIs for
   all i/o operations, using the fopen() and fclose() API only for
   opening and closing the file (because fopen()'s mode arguments are
   easier to manage).


   Peculiarities of this whio_dev implementation:

   - Because the lower-level I/O API doesn't have direct equivalents
   of feof(), ferror(), and clearerr(), devices created this way may
   behave slightly differently in some cases (involving error
   reporting) than devices created using whio_dev_for_FILE() (but
   should nonetheless behave as expected).

   - The whio_dev_ioctl_FILE_fd ioctl is supported to fetch the
   underlying file descriptor.

   - It also supports the whio_dev_ioctl_GENERAL_name ioctl() to
   report the name passed to this function. That will only work
   if the name passed to this function is static or otherwise
   stays in scope (and doesn't change addresses) for the life
   of this object.

   - It also supports the whio_dev_ioctl_FCNTL_lock_wait,
   whio_dev_ioctl_FCNTL_lock_nowait, and whio_dev_ioctl_FCNTL_lock_get
   ioctls (from the whio_dev_ioctls enum).

   - The iomode() member will return 0 or 1 depending on mode: If mode
   contains "w" or "+" then it is write mode (iomode() returns a
   positive value). If mode contains "r" and does not have a "+" then
   iomode() returns 0.

/**
   Equivalent to whio_dev_for_filename(), but takes an opened file
   descriptor and calls fdopen() on it.

   PLEASE read your local man pages for fdopen() regarding caveats in
   the setting of the mode parameter and the close()
   handling. e.g. destroying the returned device will close it, so the
   descriptor should not be used by client code after that. Likewise,
   client code should not close the descriptor as long as the returned
   device is alive. Thus ownership of the handle is effectively passed
   to the returned object, and there is no way to relinquish it.

   My local man pages say:

   @code
   The fdopen() function associates a stream with the existing file
   descriptor, fd.  The mode of the stream (one of the values "r",
   "r+", "w", "w+", "a", "a+") must be compatible with the mode of the
   file descriptor.  The file position indicator of the new stream is
   set to that belonging to fd, and the error and end-of-file
   indicators are cleared.  Modes "w" or "w+" do not cause truncation
   of the file.  The file descriptor is not dup$B!G(Bed, and will be
   closed when the stream created by fdopen() is closed.  The result
   of applying fdopen() to a shared memory object is undefined.

/**
   Creates a new whio_dev object which wraps an in-memory buffer. The
   initial memory allocated by the buffer is allocated by this call.
   Whether or not the buffer is allowed to be expanded by write() or
   seek() operations is defined by the remaining parameters.

   The expFactor specifies a growth expansion value, as follows. If
   expFactor is less than 1.0 then the buffer will never be allowed to
   expand more than the original size. If it is equal to or greater
   than 1.0, then it will be made expandable (that is, write() may
   cause it to grow). Every time its size grows, it will grow by a
   factor of expFactor (or to exactly the requested amount, for a
   factor of 1.0). e.g. 1.5 means grow by 1.5 times (a common growth
   factor for dynamic memory allocation). Likewise, when a buffer
   shrinks (via truncate()), it will be reallocated if
   (currentSize/expFactor) is greater than the number of bytes being
   used. For example, if a buffer of 1024 bytes with an expFactor of
   1.5 is being shrunk, it will not release the allocated memory
   unless doing so will drop it below ((1024/1.5)=682) bytes. A very
   large expFactor (more than 2.0) is not disallowed, but may not be
   good for your sanity.

   For purposes of the following text, a membuf device with an
   expFactor of equal to or greater than 1.0 is said to be "growable".

   If the buffer is growable then calling write() when we are at (or
   past) EOF will cause the buffer to try to expand to accommodate.
   If it cannot, or if the buffer is not growable, the write operation
   will write as much as it can fit in existing memory, then return a
   short write result.

   It not enough memory can be allocated for the intitial buffer then
   this function returns 0. On success, the caller owns the returned
   object and must eventually destroy it by calling
   dev->api->finalize(dev).

   The returned object supports all of the whio_dev interface, with
   the caveat that write() calls will not be allowed to expand out of
   bounds if the device is not growable.

   Regardless of the expansion policies, the truncate() member of the
   returned object can be used to expand the buffer. See below for
   more details.

   Peculiarities of this whio_dev implementation:

   - Whether or not the device is growable (as explained above), seeks past
   EOF are always allowed as long as the range is positive. Non-growable
   buffers will not write there, but growable ones will try to expand
   at the next write. Non-growable buffers *can* be expanded by manually
   calling truncate() on them.

   - truncate() ignores the growth policy! That is by design, to allow
   us to (optionally) manually control the growth without allowing
   rogue seek/write combinations to take up all our memory.

   - When truncate() shrinks a growable buffer: memory may or may not
   be immediately released, depending on the magnitude of the
   change. A truncate() to a size of 0 will always release the memory
   immediately.

   - When truncate() shrinks a non-growable buffer: the memory is not
   released at all because the buffer could then not be expanded
   later. When truncating a non-expanding buffer to a smaller size,
   writes() made past new EOF will cause it to expand, but only up to
   the original size given to this function. e.g. if we have a non-growable
   buffer with 1024 bytes, we can truncate() it to 10 bytes, then write
   (expanding the size) up until we reach 1024 bytes, at which point
   we cannot write any more.

   - seek() will only fail if the offset would cause the position
   counter to overflow its numeric range or would set it before the
   start of the buffer. seek() does not change the object's size, and
   writing after an out of bounds seek will cause the object to grow
   starting at that new position (if it is growable) or it will fail
   (if the buffer is not growable or cannot grow).

   - flush() is a harmless no-op.

   - ioctl(): all of the ictl operations listed in the whio_dev_ioctls
   enum and marked with whio_dev_ioctl_mask_BUFFER are supported, as
   documented in that enum. The whio_dev_ioctl_GENERAL_size ioctl
   is also supported (from the whio_dev_ioctls enum), but it returns
   the size to the virtual EOF, whereas whio_dev_ioctl_BUFFER_size
   returns the allocated size of the buffer.

   - iomode() always returns a positive value as long as its "this"
   argument is valid.

/**
   Creates a new read/write whio_dev wrapper for an existing memory
   range. For read-only access, use whio_dev_for_memmap_ro() instead.

   The arguments:

   - mem = the read/write memory the device will wrap. Ownership is
   not changed.  May not be 0. If mem's address changes during the
   lifetime of the returned object (e.g. via a realloc), results are
   undefined an almost certainly ruinous. If you want this device to
   free the memory when it is destroyed, set dev->client.data to the
   mem parameter and set dev->client.dtor to an appropriate destructor
   function (free() would suffice for memory allocated via alloc()).

   - size = the size of the mem buffer. It may not be 0. It is the
   caller's responsibility to ensure that the buffer is at least that
   long. This object will not allow i/o operations outside of that
   bound. It is good practice to ensure that the memory is zeroed out
   before passing it here, to avoid unpredictable artifacts.

   On success a new whio_dev is returned. On error (invalid
   arguments or allocation error), 0 is returned.

   Peculiarities of the memmap whio_dev wrapper:

   - trunc() operations will work, but only up to the size passed to
   this function.  That is, one can "shrink" the device by truncating
   it, then grow it back, but never larger than the original size.

   - seek() accepts past-EOF ranges, but will return
   whio_rc.SizeTError on a numeric over/underflow. Writing past EOF
   range will of course not be allowed.

   - write() on a read-only memory buffer returns 0, as opposed to
   whio_rc.SizeTError.

   - Supports the ioctl()s whio_dev_ioctl_BUFFER_size, which returns
   the allocated size of the buffer (as passed to the factory
   function), and whio_dev_ioctl_GENERAL_size, which returns the
   position of the virtual EOF. It is not yet clear if we can support
   whio_dev_ioctl_BUFFER_uchar_ptr without violating constness of
   read-only buffers.

/**
   Creates a new whio_dev object which acts as a proxy for a specified
   range of another device (that is, the object acts as a
   "subdevice"). All read/write/seek/tell operations on the returned
   object act on a range which is relative to the parent object. The
   object will not allow read/write operations outside of the given
   range.

   The arguments are:

   - parent = the parent i/o device. It must outlive the returned
   object, and ownership of parent is not changed by calling this
   function.

   - lowerBound is the logical begining-of-file for the returned
   device, relative to the coordinates of the parent.

   - upperBound is the logical "hard" EOF for the returned device -
   writes will not be allowed past this point. If 0 is passed it is
   treated as "unlimited". upperBound must be 0 or greater than
   lowerBound.

   The bounds are not checked when the subdevice is created, as some
   devices will allow one to write past EOF to extend it. If the
   bounds are not legal at read/write time then the error will be triggered
   there.  If parent is ever sized such that the given bounds are
   not longer legal, read/write errors may occur.

   Subdevices can be used to partition a larger underlying device into
   smaller pieces. By writing to/reading from the subdevices, one can
   be assured that each logical block remains separate and that any
   operation in one block will not affect any other subdevices which
   have their own blocks (barring any bugs in this code or overlapping
   byte rangees). Results are of course unpredictable if multiple
   devices map overlapping ranges in the parent device (then again,
   maybe that's what you want, e.g. as a communication channel).

   Most operations are proxied directly through the parent device,
   with some offsets added to accomodate for the bounds defined, so
   the returned object will inherit any peculiarities of the parent
   implementation (e.g. flush() requirements).

   On success a new whio_dev object is returned, which must eventually be
   destroyed by calling dev->api->finalize(dev).

   On error 0 is returned.

   Peculiarities of this whio_dev implementation:

   - read() and write() will reposition the parent cursor to the
   subdevice's position before reading/writing and re-set it when
   complete. Thus other code using the parent device need not worry
   about the subdevice hosing the cursor position. reads/writes do of
   course track the internal cursor used by the subdevice, so (for
   example) one need not manually reposition the cursor when doing
   sequential reads or writes. Likewise, seek() and tell() work independently
   of the parent device (with one exception, described below).

   - The behaviour of seek(dev,n,SEEK_END) depends partially on
   upperBound. If upperBound==0 (i.e. "no bounds") then SEEK_END will
   use the EOF of the parent device, not the subdevice. In any case,
   the value returned from tell() or seek() will be relative to the
   subdevice.

   - truncate() does not function; it simply returns
   whio_rc.UnsupportedError.  It would be feasible to handle
   truncating like the memmap whio_dev does - allow shrinking and
   growing back up to the original maximum size, but no further than
   that. This might be added at some point, but it doesn't currently
   seem to be useful enough to warrant the effort.

   - Some calls (e.g. flush(), clear_error()) are simply passed on to the
   parent device. Though it is not technically/pedantically correct to
   do so in all cases.

   - ioctl(): this type accepts ioctls described in the
   whio_dev_ioctls enum having the name prefix
   whio_dev_ioctl_SUBDEV_. See those docs for details.

   - iomode() returns the same as the parent device does.

   - It is theoretically possible to nest subdevices, and it may be
   even useful in some cases, but i haven't tried it.

   Example:


   @code
    char const * fname = "subdev.iodev";
    whio_dev * parent = whio_dev_for_filename( fname, "w+" );
    assert(parent);
    parent->api->write( parent, "!", 1 );
    parent->api->seek( parent, 99, SEEK_SET );
    parent->api->write( parent, "!", 1 );
    // parent is now 100 bytes long.
    whio_dev * sub = whio_dev_subdev_create( parent, 10, 43 );
    assert(sub);
    MARKER("Subdevice in place for file [%s]...\n", fname );

   This API contains a printf-like implementation which supports

   Authors: many, probably. This code supposedly goes back to the
   early 1980's.

   Current maintainer: Stephan Beal (http://wanderinghorse.net/home/stephan)

   License: Public Domain.

   The primary functions of interest are whprintfv() and whprintf(), which works
   similarly to printf() except that they take a callback function which they
   use to send the generated output to arbitrary destinations. e.g. one can
   supply a callback to output formatted text to a UI widget or a C++ stream
   object.
*/

/**
   @typedef long (*whprintf_appender)( void * arg, char const * data, long n )


   The whprintf_appender typedef is used to provide whprintfv()
   with a flexible output routine, so that it can be easily
   send its output to arbitrary targets.

   The policies which implementations need to follow are:

   - arg is an implementation-specific pointer (may be 0) which is
   passed to whprintf(). whprintfv() doesn't know what this argument is
   but passes it to its whprintf_appender. Typically it will be an
   object or resource handle to which string data is pushed or output.

   - The 'data' parameter is the data to append. If it contains
   embedded nulls, this function will stop at the first one. Thus
   it is not binary-safe.

   - n is the number of bytes to read from data. If n<0 then
   strlen(data) should be used.

   - Returns, on success, the number of bytes appended (may be 0).

   - Returns, on error, an implementation-specified negative number.
   Returning a negative error code will cause whprintfv() to stop the
   processing of that string. Note that 0 is a success value (some
   printf format specifiers do not add anything to the output).
*/
typedef long (*whprintf_appender)( void * arg,
				   char const * data,
				   long n );


/**
  This function works similarly to classical printf implementations,
  but instead of outputing somewhere specific, it uses a callback
  function to push its output somewhere. This allows it to be used for
  arbitrary external representations. It can be used, for example, to
  output to an external string, a UI widget, or file handle (it can
  also emulate printf by outputing to stdout this way).

 INPUTS:

 pfAppend : The is a whprintf_appender function which is responsible
 for accumulating the output. If pfAppend returns a negative integer
 then processing stops immediately.

 pfAppendArg : is ignored by this function but passed as the first
 argument to pfAppend. pfAppend will presumably use it as a data
 store for accumulating its string.

 fmt : This is the format string, as in the usual printf().

 ap : This is a pointer to a list of arguments.  Same as in
 vprintf() and friends.


 OUTPUTS:

 The return value is the total number of characters sent to the
 function "func", or a negative number on a pre-output error. If this
 function returns an integer greater than 1 it is in general
 impossible to know if all of the elements were output. As such
 failure can only happen if the callback function returns an error,
 and this type of error is very rare in a printf-like context, this is
 not considered to be a significant problem. (The same is true for any
 classical printf implementations, as far as i'm aware.)


 CURRENT (documented) PRINTF EXTENSIONS:

 %%z works like %%s, but takes a non-const (char *) and whprintf()
 deletes the string (using free()) after appending it to the output.

 %%h (HTML) works like %s but converts certain characters (like '<' and '&' to
 their HTML escaped equivalents.

 %%t (URL encode) works like %%s but converts certain characters into a representation
 suitable for use in an HTTP URL. (e.g. ' ' gets converted to %%20)

 %%T (URL decode) does the opposite of %t - it decodes URL-encoded
 strings.

 %%r requires an int and renders it in "ordinal form". That is,
 the number 1 converts to "1st" and 398 converts to "398th".

 %%q quotes a string as required for SQL. That is, '\'' characters get
 doubled.

 %%Q as %%q, but includes the outer '\'' characters and null pointers
 replaced by SQL NULL.

 (The %%q and %%Q specifiers are options inherited from this printf
 implementation's sqlite3 genes.)

 These extensions may be disabled by setting certain macros when
 compiling whprintf.c (see that file for details).

/** @def WHEFS_ID_TYPE_BITS

WHEFS_ID_TYPE_BITS tells us how many bits to use for inode and data
block IDs. The supported values are 8, 16, 32, or 64, and libraries
compiled with different values will not be compatible (nor can they
read the others' format, though i'm looking into ways to be able to
enable that).

The number of bits here is significant because:

- We are limited to (2^WHEFS_ID_TYPE_BITS-2) inodes and blocks
(but for all practical purposes, this isn't a limitation even with
16 bits).

- The layout of the filesystem is dependent on the number of bits in
this type, as the number of bytes used for certain data fields changes.

- When/if inode or block caching is added, the cache size will incrase
by (WHEFS_ID_TYPE_BITS/8) for each ID field stored in the cache
(that's a minimum of 2 IDs per object, and maybe up to 6 per inode
once directory support is added). The number grows quickly.

In practice, a 16-bit ID type is completely sufficient, but the
library was originally created with size_t as the identifier type, so
it supports 32-bit IDs as well. The switch to 16 as the default was
made to help save memory when/if inode caching gets added to the
library. In any case, the filesystem's minimalistic implementation is
not scalable to tens of thousands of files, and so 16 bits is a very
realistic limit.

In theory, 64-bit IDs are also okay, but (A) for this particular use
case that is way overkill, (B) it's a huge waste of memory (8 bytes
where we realistically don't need more than 2), and (C) the filesystem
model itself is not scalable to that level of use (e.g. billions of
files). inode/block IDs are always sequential, starting at 1, and by
the time we hit that number of blocks or inodes, the computer's memory
would almost certainly be filled.

i would strongly prefer to have WHEFS_ID_TYPE_BITS as an enum constant
instead of a macro value, but we unfortunately need some conditional
compilation based on the bit count.

If this constant is changed, all whefs client code which depends on it
must be recompiled and all filesystems written using the old value
will not be readable. That is the reason it is not set up with an
ifndef guard, so clients cannot blithely change it. If you are copying
whefs directly into another project, feel free to change the value all
you want, but be aware of the compatibility ramifications. Doing so
may also screw up any printf() (or similar) commands which have a
hard-coded format specifier which no longer matches after changing
this value. To work around this, the constant WHEFS_ID_TYPE_PFMT gets
defined (dependent on the value of WHEFS_ID_TYPE_BITS) and can be used
in place of hard-coding the printf format specifier.

    @mainpage whefs: Embedded/Virtual Filesystem

   ACHTUNG: this is beta software!

   whefs is a C library implementing an embedded/virtual filesystem
   (EFS or VFS).  It works by creating a so-called container file. This API
   can then treat that container similarly to a filesystem. In essence
   this is similar to conventional archives (e.g. zip files), except
   that this library provides random-access read/write support to the
   fs via an API similar to fopen(), fread(), fwrite() and
   friends. Also, an EFS container is more like a real filesystem than
   (e.g.) a zip file because the container's size is fixed when it is
   created.

/** @page whefs_naming_conventions whefs API Naming conventions

The whefs API uses the following API naming conventions:

Functions and types all begin with the prefix "whefs_". Function
are always (or nearly always) declared in the form:

whefs_NOUN_VERB( NOUN theObject, ... )

The NOUN part(s) refer to an object or a member of an object, and the
VERB part is the action (or actions) to perform on the given object.

For example, the function to set an inode's name is
whefs_inode_name_set().  This is arguably less intuitive than the more
conventional-sounding whefs_inode_set_name() or
whefs_set_inode_name(), but this approach was chosen because:

- The ordering is natural if one thinks in an OO
mindset. e.g. inode.name.set(foo).

- When the API docs are generated in sorted order, it's easy to find
all operations for a given noun (object type). e.g. whefs_inode_name_set()
and whefs_inode_name_get() will be grouped together.

- Experience has shown it to be easily and consistently applicable,
and simple to remember because it follows a simple rule. "Was that
foo_set_name() or set_foo_name()?" Just remember that the noun comes
first. When there are multiple nouns (e.g. 'foo' and 'name'), they are
in descending order based on their parentage/ownership/API
significance.

The public whefs API is all declared in whefs.h, but the library
internally uses several headers which declare the private API -
functions and types which should never be used by client code. These
include all functions or types with the following prefixes:

- whefs_inode
- whefs_block
- whefs_file or whefs_fs, UNLESS it is declared in whefs.h (in which case it is public)

The internal API is subject to change at any time, and should never
be relied upon as a stable interface.

whefs is based off of another library, whio, and some of those details
"leak through" the whefs abstraction and are visible in the public
whefs API. While whio can be considered to be a private implementation
detail, it is nonetheless fully open to public use because it is an
independent API. whefs' usage of whio is compatible with the whio
public API and conventions, and there is no problem in mixing the APIs
in client code. For example, it is possible to use whio routines which
are not part of the whefs API on whefs-supplied i/o devices (e.g. the
whio gzip compression routines can be used on whefs-supplied i/o
devices).

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {

/** @page page_whefs_file_format whefs container file format

The file format is described briefly (and informally) below...

(Begin file format...)

[CORE_MAGIC_BYTES] 4 integer values which must match the magic bytes expected
by a particular version. The 4th value of these bytes tells us whether we
use 16- or 32-bit inode and block IDs. Libraries compiled with a different
ID bit size will not be compatible.

[FILE_SIZE] 1 integer value. This provides a good sanity check when
opening an existing vfs.

[CLIENT_MAGIC_LENGTH] length (in bytes) of the following sequence...

[CLIENT_MAGIC_BYTES] "magic cookie" for this vfs. Determined by the client.

FS OPTIONS:
    - [BLOCK_SIZE] byte size of each block
    - [BLOCK_COUNT] number of blocks
    - [INODE_COUNT] number of "inodes" (filesystem entries)
    - [FILE_NAME_LENGTH]

[INODE_NAMES_TABLE]

Each inode name is composed of:

    - [TAG_BYTE] consistency-checking byte
    - [ID] stored only for consistency/error checking
    - [STRING_SIZE] number of used bytes encoded as a uint16_t.
    - The string data. Encoding is left to the client.

[INODE_LIST]

The inode list, 1 node per entry, starting with ID 1. ID 0 is
reserved for invalid/uninitialized inodes. ID 1 is reserved for a root
directory entry.

Each inode is stored as:

    - [TAG_BYTE] a consistency-checking byte
    - [ID]
    - [FIRST_BLOCK_ID]
    - [FLAGS]
    - [MODIFICATION_TIME]
    - [DATA_SIZE] the size of the associated pseudofile

[DATA BLOCKS] fixed-length blocks. Each block is stored as:

   - [TAG_BYTE] a sanity-checking byte.

   - [BLOCK_ID] not strictly necessary (we can calculate it), but it may
   be useful for error checking/correction. Starts at 1, not 0, as ID 0
   is reserved for invalid blocks.

   - [FLAGS] internal flags

   - [NEXT_BLOCK_ID] id of the next data block. Updated when a write()
   overflows a block or a file shrinks (thereby dropping blocks).

   - [BLOCK OF BYTES], a block for the data bytes of a pseudofile.
   The size is a property of the vfs object.

[EOF]

(...end file format)

For portability, numbers are stored in a platform-independent
manner. They are stored as char arrays, with a tag byte as the first
byte and the rest of the number stored in the following N bytes in
big-endian format, where N is the number of bytes in the numeric type
(e.g. uint32_t is stored as (1+4)=5 bytes and uint8_t is stored as two
bytes). The tag byte is used for data consistency checking, and each
encoded type has its own tag byte identifier which, by convention,
has a value greater than 127 (to help avoid false hits on ASCII input).

Reminder to self: storing the numbers little-ending might actually
make more sense because then we could use the decoding routines for
smaller data types on encoded data from larger data without having to
do any byte skipping or extra range checking. This is similar to the reason
which little-endian machines have fewer problems porting up to higher
bitness than big-endian machines have.


Limitations:

- We are stuck with 32 bit support only for now. i do not have a 64-bit
machine to play on. Also, we are currently using fseek() in some code,
and that is restricted to signed long values, so we have got a 2GB
container size limitation.

- File names are internally (char const *). Encoding/code
page is up to the user.

   Opens a "pseudofile" within the given filesystem.

   mode is similar to the fopen() mode parameter, only the following
   are currently recognized:

   - "r" = read-only mode

   - "r+" = read/write mode, positioned at the start of the file.
   Currently, 'r+' will cause the file to be created if it does
   not exist, but this behaviour may change to more closely match
   that of fopen() (where 'w+' takes that role).

   Any other characters are currently ignored. There are no plans
   to support the various "append" options.

   To avoid potential "misinteractions", the VFS will not allow any
   given file to be opened in write mode more than once at a
   time. That is, once a file is opened in write mode, all other
   attempts to open it in write mode will fail. Multiple readers are
   allowed, even if the file is already opened for writing.

   On success, a new file handle is returned. On error, 0 is returned,
   but to discover the nature of the problem you'll have to use a
   debugger. (Hint: it's likely that the requested file wasn't found,
   could not be created (e.g. VFS full), is already opened for write
   mode, or any of 37 other potential errors. Just pick one.)

   Potential errors are:

   - allocation error while setting up the internal data.
   - (mode=="r") and no such entry is found
   - (mode=="r+"), the file is not found, and no free inode could be
   found (FS is full), or the file is already opened in write mode.
   - A general i/o error
   - The filesystem is opened read-only and read/write access was requested.

   Design notes:

   The main purpose of whefs_file is to provide an API which is close
   enough to the C FILE API that we can easily swap them out. That
   said, whefs_file is basically a very thin wrapper around a whio_dev
   specialization which is designed to work with whefs_fs. See whefs_fdev()
   for more information on that.

   Bugs:

   This routine is exceedingly inefficient - the lack of inode name
   caching means it must do an O(N) search, where N =
   whefs_fs_options_get(fs)->inode_count.

   @see whefs_fdev()
   @see whefs_dev_open()

   Similar to whefs_fopen(), but returns a whio_dev instead of a
   whefs_file.  On success the caller owns the returned object, which
   must be destroyed by calling dev->finalize(dev). The device will be
   positioned at the beginning of the file.

   The returned object has the same overall behaviours as a whefs_file,
   and can be used in place of a whefs_file wherever it is convenient
   to do so (personally i prefer the whio_dev interface).

   If the filesystem is opened read-only then this operation will fail
   if writeMode is true.

   Peculiarities of the returned whio_dev object, vis-a-vis the whio_dev interface
   specifications, include:

   - write() updates the mtime and size of the associated inode, but
   does not flush that info to disk until flush() is called on the i/o
   device. Closing the device will automatically flush it. A read-only
   device will never update the on-disk state of the inode and shares
   a copy of the inode with all other files/devices opened for that
   inode (so it will see changes in the inode's size).

   - write()ing past EOF will allocate new VFS data blocks, if
   needed. If such an operation fails because it fills the filesystem,
   the device may have been partially expanded and may need to be
   manually truncated to free up VFS space.  This could convievably be
   considered to be a bug.

   - To keep pseudofiles from hammering each other's virtual cursor
   positions, all seek() requests are deferred until the next read or
   write. Thus a seek will only fail if the combination of arguments
   is bogus (e.g. a numeric overflow or a request to move before the
   start of the file). Because of this behaviour, seek() and tell()
   are O(1).

/** @struct whefs_string

   whefs_string is a type for storing strings. Routines in the whefs
   library which perform string operations may use this type, as
   opposed to a simple string, because it allows us to re-use the
   string's bytes at certain times instead of using malloc for every
   string.

   One way to free the memory owned by these objects is
   whefs_string_clear(). Alternately, one may pass the string member
   to free() (assuming it was created using malloc()), then set the
   length and alloced members to 0. If the object is part of a chain,
   the caller must free each object in the chain.

   If the maximum size of a set of strings is known in advance it is
   possible to avoid any allocation by using this approach:

   @code
   enum { bufSize = MaxPossibleSizeOfStrings + 1 }; // +1 for the trailing NULL
   char buf[bufSize];
   memset( buf, 0, bufSize );
   whefs_string s = whefs_string_init;
   s.string = buf;
   s.alloced = bufSize;
   whefs_string_copy_cstring( &s, sourceString );
   assert( (s.string == buf) );
   @endcode

   Use this approach ONLY when working with strings with a known fixed
   upper length, or else the whefs_string API might try to realloc()
   the static buffer and will likely segfault in doing so. e.g. in
   whefs we know the maximum length of filenames at compile time, and
   can optimize out some calls to malloc() by using stack-allocated
   buffers.

/**
   Like the 'ls' Unix program, this function fetches a list of
   filenames matching the given pattern. If no matches are found, null
   is returned, otherwise a string list is returned and count (if it
   is not null) is set to the number of items in the list.

   A pattern of null or an empty string is equivalent to a pattern of
   "*" (but much faster, since it doesn't need to be compared).

   The returned list must be freed by calling whefs_string_finalize()
   and passing true as the second parameter.

   Example usage:

   @code
    whefs_string * ls = whefs_ls( myFS, "*.c", 0 );
    whefs_string * head = ls;
    while( ls )
    {

   BUG:

   This routine has no way of reporting an error. If some sort of I/O
   error happens after an entry has been fetched, the entries matched
   so far are returned but there is no way of knowing how many entries
   would have been returned if all could have been read. That said, if
   the first entry is read successfully, it is "reasonable to assume"
   that the remaining entries could be read as well. In fact, since
   only "used" entries are considered for matching, any entries
   returned here must have been read previously (to build the
   used-items cache), and only a true I/O error (or corruption of the
   VFS container) should cause a failure here.

   Ownership of src is not changed. On success, this routine will

   On success, whefs_rc.OK is returned.

   On error, any number of different codes might be returned, both

   If the import fails and the entry did not exist before the import
   started, it is removed from the filesystem. If it did exist then
   exactly what happens next depends on a few factors:

   - If the import failed because the existing file could not be
   expanded to its new size then it is kept intact, with its old
   size. This step happens first, before any writing is done.

   - If the import failed during the copy process then the destination
   file is left in an undefined state and it should probably be
