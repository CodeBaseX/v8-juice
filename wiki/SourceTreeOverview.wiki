#summary Overview of the source tree
#labels Phase-Implementation

The source tree has a relatively elaborate setup, with ease-of-expansion being a primary goal. It's based primarily off of the tree used in the libs11n project, and this structure has proven to be very flexible over the years.

It's laid out like this and ordered more or less by their dependencies:

{{{
src/              All source code is under here...
  +-- include/
    +-- v8/
      +-- juice/  Headers go somewhere under here
  +-- lib/
    +-- juice/    The core library
    +-- plugins/  Plugins go under here
      +-- sqlite3/
      +-- ncurses/
      +-- whio/
      +-- sprintf/
      ...
  +-- client/     Library client apps go under here
    +-- shell/    JS shell with juice functionality added on
    +-- sample/   Sample applications
    ...
doc/              Docs go here
  +-- doxygen/    Doxygen-generated docs
  +-- manual/     Library manual
  +-- plugins/    Non-API docs for individual plugins
}}}

Any directories not listed there are probably part of the build process, or tools used by that process, and are not considered part of the library.

When including headers in implementation files, the preferred syntax is:
{{{
#include <v8/some_header.h> // or .hpp, or .hh, or whatever
}}}
and the build process should add `-Isrc/include` to the precompiler flags.
