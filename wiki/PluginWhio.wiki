=The whio plugin=

The whio plugin adds i/o support to JS. It gets its name from the i/o library it is based on: http://fossil.wanderinghorse.net/repos/whio/

This plugins provides:

  * Class whio.IODevice, which models random-access devices. The back-end supports, in principal, a wide variety of data stores, but v8's class construction mechanism makes it unduly difficult to add the support needed for, e.g., in-memory i/o devices or client-provided back-ends (like [http://fossil.wanderinghorse.net/repos/whefs/ whefs], which i had planned to add bindings for).
  * TODO: Classes whio.InStream and whio.OutStream, which model sequential-access devices.

==C++ usage==

When using the plugins API, you don't need to do anything C++-side to use this addon - simply load it described [Plugins on the plugins wiki page].

==JS usage==

{{{
var dev = new whio.IODevice("/path/to/file", true); // true= Write-mode
dev.truncate(0);
dev.write("Hi, world!");
...
dev.close();
}}}

==TODOs==

  * InStream and OutStream classes, for sequential streams. We can then add whio.stdout and whio.stderr shared objects.
  * Make the vals from whio_rc.XXX available via whio.rc.XXX. whio_rc.SizeTError needs special handling due to (potentially) different sizes in the underlying numeric types.
