=v8-juice ChangeLog=

This is the informal ChangeLog for the v8-juice project. Newest items
are at the top. Dates written extra large are release dates. This contains only a high-level list of changes. The exact list of changes can be fished out of our source code repository at:

  * http://code.google.com/p/v8-juice/source/browse
  * http://code.google.com/p/v8-juice/source/list

----

*2009 Sept 12*
  * Added (experimental) `setTimeout()`, `cancelTimeout()`, and `sleep()` (which relinquishes control to other threads). The first two work mostly like their browser equivalents, but need more testing in order to determine if their multi-threaded use of v8 is kosher. See [BindableFunctions].
  * Other minor touchups i've been collecting over the summer.

*2009 May 27*

  * Patch from robtsuk: `v8::juice::IncludeScript()` (JS `include()`) now returns a live reference instead of a dead one, fixing a crash when the return value of `include()` was dereferenced.

==2009 April 4==
  * New release.

*2009 March 31*
  * Added toggles to [CreatingJSClasses WeakJSClassCreator] to allow constructors to be called without `new` and to activate searches for the native `this` object via JS-side prototypes (necessary if JS types are to subclass native types).
  * Minor additions to the [PluginNCurses ncurses plugin].

*2009 March 28/29*
  * Moved the remaining plugins from the core tree to the [http://code.google.com/p/v8-juice/source/browse/extra-plugins/src extra-plugins source repo].
  * The [ConvertingTypes convert.h code] is now independent of the rest of the library.
  * The [CreatingJSClasses WeakJSClassCreator cast operators] can now cast from JS to `(T&)` and `(T const &)`. This means functions taking reference types can now be bound.  The conversions must throw a std::exception if the conversion fails, to avoid dereferencing null. The function forwarding framework will catch such exceptions and return the result as a JS exception, rather than letting the native exception propagate through v8 (which can lead to a corrupt stack).
  * Added the `--print-cerr` command line option `v8-juice-shell`. This forces the JS `print()` function to use `std::cerr` for output instead of `std::cout`, which is often helpful when debugging [PluginNCurses curses applications] (we can then redirect `print()` to another console without hosing the curses screen state).


==2009 March 25==
  * New release.

*2009 March 24*
  * Found a way to support dual native- and JS-side inheritance via [CreatingJSClasses WeakJSClassCreator], and refactored [PluginNCurses the ncurses plugin] to use it.
  * The past few days have mostly been spent reimplementing [PluginNCurses the ncurses plugin], which is once again in a usable state (but has a much different API than before).

*2009 March 21*
  * Started adding `ToSource()` to convert native types to JS source code. Has some notable limitations but basically works.
  * Added gzip/gunzip support for [PluginWhio input streams].
  * Added [PluginWhefs embedded filesystem plugin].

==2009 March 18==
  * Released new tarball

*2009 March 17*
  * More work on the sqlite3 plugin. Reimplemented sqlite3_exec() using the newer OO API.

*2009 March 16*
  * Added support for binding JS/C++ member variables (as opposed to functions). Supports all types which work with `CastToJS()` and `CastFromJS()`.

*2009 March 15*
  * Started reimplementing the [PluginSQLite3 sqlite3 plugin] to use class binding, rather an v8::External, for most argument handling.

*2009 March 13/14*
  * Refactored member function binding code significantly.
  * Many minor cleanups.
  * Completely wrapped [PathFinderClass the PathFinder class] in JS using only `ClassBinder`.


*2009 March 12* (after the release, i think)
  * Got binding to non-const member functions, and those returning void, working.

==*2009 March 12*==
  * Released new version.

*2009 March 9/10*
  * Added initial JS class creation helpers. See [CreatingJSClasses] wiki page for info.
  * General improvements to the [PluginWhio i/o plugin].

*2009 March 8*
  * Added [http://code.google.com/p/v8-juice/source/browse/#svn/extra-plugins extra-plugins] directory to svn, for plugins with hard dependencies on external/3rd-party software. Moved sqlite3/ncurses plugins into that tree.
  * Added new plugin: [PluginReadline readline]
  * Several little improvements/additions to the [PluginWhio I/O classes].

==2009 March 7==

  * Released the first tarball.

*2009 March 6*

Started porting in the original source tree to Google Code.
