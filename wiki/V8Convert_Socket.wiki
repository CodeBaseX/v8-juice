=Overview=

This page gives an overview of a `Socket` class binding implemented using [V8Convert]. It "should" be relatively easy to drop in to arbitrary client apps.

This API was released on 20110619 and is still (as of this writing) quite experimental.

==Getting the Source==

This code requires [V8Convert] (which is header-only). The sources are here:

  [http://code.google.com/p/v8-juice/source/browse/convert/addons/]

This module needs both the `socket` and `bytearray` directories. If you are building it directly from a checked-out copy of the main source, running `make` will also build a sample/test shell which includes the bindings.

==Adding the Bindings to your App==

Grab the above source code and add the `cpp` files to your project (optionally compiling them as a separate static library or DLL).

{{{
#include "path/to/socket.hpp"
...
v8::convert::JSSocket::SetupBindings( yourV8Object );
}}}

The bindings will be added to the given object, which is normally the v8 context's global object.

=Socket Class=

|| *Method* || *Description* ||
|| `new Socket( [int family=AF_INET [, int type=SOCK_STREAM [, int protocol=0]]] )` || Constructor. TODO: add a ctor taking a configuration Object ||
|| `void close()` || Closes the socket and frees all resources. Further access to native methods or properties on this object will leads to JS-side exceptions.  ||
|| `string toString()` || Returns a debugging-style string. ||
|| `int bind( string hostNameOrAddress, int port )` || "Binds" the socket to a given host/port. Throws on error. ||
|| `int connect( string hostNameOrAddress, int port )` || Connects to the given host/port. Throws on error ||
|| `mixed read(unsigned int length[, bool binary=false])` || Reads up to `length` bytes of data from the socket. Returns a `string` if `binary` is false, else a `ByteArray` instance. ||
|| `int write(string|ByteArray data [,int length=data.length])` || Writes the given data to the socket. Returns the number of bytes written. ||
|| `int setTimeout( unsigned int seconds[, unsigned int microseconds=0] )` || Sets the i/o timeout for read/write operations. ||
|| `int setTimeoutMs( unsigned int ms )` || Sets the timeout in milliseconds. ||
|| *Property* || *Description* ||
|| `Array[string address,int port] peerInfo` || Only valid after a connection is established. ||
|| `bool timeoutReached` || If a `read()` or `write()` call fails due to a timeout then this will be `true`. The value is re-set on each call to `read()` or `write()`. ||

|| *Class-level Functions* || *Description* ||
|| `int getProtoByName( string protocolName )` || Returns the integer value for a given protocol name (e.g. `tcp`, `udp`, or `ntp`) ||
|| `string nameToAddress( string hostname )` || Resolves a host name to an address. ||
|| `string addressToName( string address )` || Resolves an address to a host name. ||


The `Socket` constructor also has the following numeric properties, all of which map directly to C-side constants: `AF_INET`, `AF_INET6`, `AF_UNIX`, `AF_UNSPEC`, `SOCK_DGRAM`, `SOCK_STREAM`, `SOCK_SEQPACKET`, `SOCK_RAW`.

=!ByteArray Class=

This class is used by the `Socket` class to allow the moderately efficient usage of binary data with !JavaScript. It is visible to client code via `Socket.ByteArray`. It is basically an Array-like class which is capable of holding arbitrary data (string or binary) read from or being written to a socket.

`ByteArray` implements the index-of operator like arrays to, but each value at a given index is a single byte (a small integer).

||*Function* || *Description* ||
||`new ByteArray([int length=0])` || Creates a new byte array holding the given number of bytes. ||
||`new ByteArray(string data [int length=0])` || Creates a new byte array from the given string. ||
|| `int index-operator[int index]` || Returns the byte value at the given index. When changing values, an out-of-range index leads to an exception. Set `length` to explicitly expand a `ByteArray`. TODO: add `autoExpand` option. ||

||*Property* || *Description* ||
|| `int length` || The length of the object's data, in bytes. May be modified. When growing, new bytes have the value `0`. ||
|| `stringValue` || Converts the data to a JS string. Results are undefined if the data is not UTF8-encoded string data. Note that it performs the conversion on each read access, so copy a reference if you want to refer to it multiple times! Setting this property will cause an exception to be thrown. ||

TODOs:

  * `append(ByteArray|string|int)`
