=The sqlite3 bindings=

The sqlite3 bindings wrap about 60 sqlite3 functions for use in JavaScript, providing access to database files from script code.

All of the most significant features of sqlite3 are supported except:

  *  Custom collation sequences (no plans to implement these)
  *  Custom authorization functions (also no plans)
  *  The BLOB-related functions are missing. There would seem to be relatively few safe (in terms of type conversion) ways to use this from JS.
  *  The UTF16 functions are missing, as v8 does not directly support UTF16 (only in a roundabout manner).

Everything else one would "normally" need from script code is scriptable, including custom SQL functions via `sqlite3_create_function()`. The API provides native-side access to the DB handles created from script code, so clients can extend their script-side DBs using functionality not provided by these bindings.

These bindings are a direct port of the "original" bindings, which where implemented for SpiderMonkey and are described here:
